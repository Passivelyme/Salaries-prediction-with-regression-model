# Performing various Regression models on salaries dataset

### Models used are:
    
-> SLR(Support Vector Regression) is a basic and commonly used statistical method in the field of machine learning and statistics. It is used for analyzing and modeling the relationship between two variables, where one is the predictor (independent variable) and the other is the response (dependent variable).

-> Random Forest Regression is an advanced machine learning method that expands the idea of Random Forest from classifying data to making predictions about numerical values. It's a robust and flexible algorithm for forecasting continuous, numeric outcomes. Essentially, Random Forest is a collection of numerous decision trees working together to produce accurate predictions.

-> The Decision Tree is a well-known machine learning algorithm employed for both classification and regression purposes. It takes the form of a tree-like structure, aiding in decision-making or forecasting by repeatedly dividing the dataset into smaller segments according to the input feature values.Furthermore, Decision Tree Regression is a machine learning technique specifically utilized for addressing regression tasks. This particular model, based on decision trees, is tailored for the prediction of continuous numeric outcomes.

-> The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a versatile and potent machine learning algorithm applicable to both classification and regression tasks. It excels by determining the most effective hyperplane for dividing data into separate categories in classification or forecasting continuous numerical values in regression. Support Vector Regression (SVR) is an adaptation of SVM tailored for regression, extending its capabilities from classifying to predicting numeric outcomes.

-> Elastic Net Regression is a type of linear regression that combines the penalties of both Lasso (L1 regularization) and Ridge (L2 regularization) regression techniques. It's designed to address some of the limitations of Lasso and Ridge regression.
